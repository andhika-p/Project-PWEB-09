			<h3>KUTA BEACH</h3>

            Once a lonely little village on the road from Denpasar to Bukit Peninsula, Kuta is now the tourist
            Mecca of Bali, popular mainly among the young and adventurous. Kuta beach is one of the first
            favorite beaches discovered by tourist. Coconut trees line the sand beach as far as the eyes can
            see towards the north stopped by the runway of Denpasar's airport far in the west. The sunset in
            Kuta is most breathtaking. On the south, the beach is fenced by the airport's runway, which gives
            the visitors a breathtaking landing experience. Kuta Beach bustles with tourists' vendors and
            locals. It's the most popular beach in Bali and the island's number one party zone. The beach
            stretches as far north as the eyes can see. As short walk away north, the waves will invite to
            surfing. Rapid development and an influx of visitors haven't kept the surfers away and Kuta still
            remains one of Bali's best surfing beaches and a great place to enjoy a beach lifestyle.  
			<br>
			While the surfers are still part of the Kuta scene, it's the shopping, nightlife and party vibes that
            attracts thousands of visitors. There's a huge choice of accommodation, restaurants and
            entertainment. The accommodation in Kuta range from a modest home stay for a few dollars a
            night to luxurious, five star, international hotels costing several hundred to several thousand
            dollars a night. Legian Street, situated directly behind the row of hotels that face the beach, is
            lined with shops of all varieties. We can find any Balinese handicrafts here, from the least
            expensive to the most exquisite; or unique stores such as the leather store staffed by two young
            Balinese men that will perfectly sculpt a leather jacket. (They are all extremely talented artists).
            _At night, Kuta is alive with night life. Western influences create discotheques, dance clubs, and
            pubs. Gastronomical demands inspire a multitude of restaurants, serving traditional Indonesian
            and Balinese food to various ethnic meals from Japan, Switzerland, etc.

            There are plenty of taxis that can take you to Kuta beach. You can rent these by the meter or by
            the hour. Taking your own car is not recommended as parking here is very tight.
            Moving around Kuta it's very fun and simple. You can go around on foot or you can rent a bike
            or motorcycle.
