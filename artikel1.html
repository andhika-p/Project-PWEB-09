			Tanah Lot is located about 12 kilometers from Tabanan City and 20 kilometers from Denpasar.
            The area comprises a wondrous mixture of natural beauty and sheer human effort. Here lies an
            idyllic white sand beach with crashing waves, complemented by a small yet majestic temple.
            This temple, known as Pura Tanah Lot, juts out to sea on a rocky background. Tanah Lot attracts
            throngs of both locals and tourists daily. Most come here longing to catch a glimpse of the
            romantic Tanah Lot sunsets, a regular occurrence during the dry season (April to November).

			The royal Taman Ayun temple was built by one of the last priests to come to Bali from Java in
            the 16th century. The temple stands on the top of a huge rock, surrounded by the sea and is one
            of Bali's most important sea temples. Tanah Lot pays homage to the guardian spirits of the sea.
            Ancient rituals pay homage to the guardian spirits of the sea. Poisonous sea snakes found in the
            caves at the base of the rocky island are believed to be guardians of the temple, standing Virgil
            against evil spirits and intruders. At the base of the rocky island are poisonous sea snakes
            believed to guard the temple from evil spirits and intruders. The best time to see Tanah Lot is in
            the late afternoon when the temple is in silhouette.

            Tanah Lot is located around 30 km away from Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar. Coming from
            Denpasar on the main highway and arriving in the town of Kediri, you will certainly not miss the
            large sign at the main intersection announcing the southwest turn to Pura Tanah Lot. To reach
            the temple of Tanah Lot you will need to cross some dry land then climb a hill to reach the site
            of the temple.
