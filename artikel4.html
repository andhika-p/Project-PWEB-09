            In Bedugul there is a beautiful Beratan Lake appeared around 1,239 meters above sea levels.
            Beratan Lake is located next to Mount Bratan and Mount Catur. It is the second largest lake in
            Bali. You can see directly because is located on the edge of highway Bedugul. Exactly located in
            Candi Kuning Village, Baturiti District of Tabanan. Beratan Lake is a lake that first passed when
            you come from Denpasar and about 300 meters from the Bedugul Botanical Garden. The lake is
            located on the right road when heading Singaraja. Beratan is perfect place for water sports such
            as para sailing, motor boating, jet skiing, water skiing, canoeing, etc. Bedugul fertile soil also
            produced abundance of plants and trees, some of them formed rain forests with their exotic birds,
            monkeys, and other creatures.
            <br>
            <br>
            A good road runs from Singaraja's western bus station to Bedugul, using 'bemo' or minibus. If
            heading north to Singaraja, take a 'bemo' from Denpasar's Ubung Station to Bedugul-a faster
            route to the north coast than via Kintamani. Bands of dark, heavy-coated monkeys are often seen
            along this road. If coming into Bedugul from the south, the first right turn is to Taman Rekreasi.
            If you go straight ahead the road passes through of Candikuning Village and Pancasari on the
            west shore of Beratan Lake before climbing through the pass of the water at Puncak to begin its
            steep winding drop to the northern plains.
            <br>
            Another nice experience is to walk the 25-km-long track from Bedugul to Kintamani. You're also
            within striking distance of the mountain area or Munduk. Just head north by road to Gitgit, then
            turn east. Stop in at pristine Tamblingan Lakeen route.
